# The PADS  
  
Generate the following two result sets:  

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).  
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:  
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.  
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.  
  
**Note:** There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.  
  
**Input Format** 
The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:

  # New Companies

  Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies.

  Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:

  Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

**Note:**

- The tables may contain duplicate records.
- The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

**Input Format**

The following tables contain company data:

Company: The company_code is the code of the company and founder is the founder of the company.

# The Report

You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12891/1443818166-a5c852caa0-1.png)

Grades contains the following data:

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12891/1443818137-69b76d805c-2.png)

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.
