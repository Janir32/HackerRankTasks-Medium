# Weather Observation Station 18

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

    SELECT ROUND((ABS(MIN(LAT_N)-MAX(LAT_N))+ABS(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W))),4) 
    FROM STATION;

# Weather Observation Station 19

Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in **STATION**.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

    SELECT TRUNC((SQRT(POWER((MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N)),2)+POWER((MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W)),2))),4) 
    FROM STATION;

# Weather Observation Station 20

A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

    SELECT ROUND(MEDIAN(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION;
